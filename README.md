# AI-Financial-Analysis
I've developed an AI-Powered Financial Forecasting & Valuation System tailored for Indian companies using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit. 📊💡

This system allows users to upload financial Excel sheets (like Jio Financials), auto-cleans them, and performs revenue/profit forecasting — all wrapped in a polished, interactive Streamlit app with multi-company batch processing.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ Upload & process raw Excel financial data
✅ Clean and structure data intelligently using Python
✅ Forecast key metrics (Revenue, Net Profit, Cash Flow, etc.)
✅ Visualize insights with dynamic Plotly graphs
✅ Export results in Excel format for easy reporting

🔧 Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Plotly | Scikit-learn | Streamlit

This is just the beginning — I'm now working on:
 📈 Adding valuation models (DCF, P/E, ROCE)
 📊 Generating buy/sell/hold signals
 📎 PDF reports & LLM-based financial assistants
